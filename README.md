# Module 1 Project Description

In this project, we refractored Horiseon's HTML and CSS code for the purpose of improving overall user accessibility and SEO, as well as organization and clarity for future developers.

Below is a list of improvements that were made during this project:

- Added comments to HTML and CSS for organizational purposes
- Certain `div` elements in the HTML were replaced with more accurate sematic elements for SEO and developer clarity.
- Cut down on the overuse of `class` attributes in the HTML and applied the styles to the parent elements to consolidate CSS code.
- Improved indentation & spacing.
